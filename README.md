# Fraud Detection & Customer Intelligence Platform
Advanced multimodal AI pipeline combining Vision Transformers and Graph Neural Networks for real-time fraud detection, achieving 94% accuracy with explainable AI framework reducing false positives by 85%.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive fraud detection system that processes 500K+ transactions daily using Apache Kafka for real-time streaming, multimodal deep learning models (Vision Transformers and GNNs), and SHAP-based explainability to provide transparent, actionable fraud predictions.
